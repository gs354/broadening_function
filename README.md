### Code written during my studies to measure radial velocities of the components of eclipsing binaries and triple systems, based on the broadening function technique described by Slavek Rucinski: 
- http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~rucinski/SVDcookbook.html
- https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~rucinski/BFdescription.html
- Rucinski, S. M., 1992, AJ, 104, 1968; Rucinski, S. M., 2002, AJ, 124, 1746.

The notebook is used to make the broadening functions from spectra.
Versions of the scripts in bf_fit were used to infer parameter distributions with MCMC and GPs - they need a lot of tidying up!


- Only the requirements for the notebook are currently in the TOML
